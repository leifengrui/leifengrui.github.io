When I was young I'd listen to the radio

Waiting for my favorite songs

When they played I'd sing along,

It made me smile.

Those were such happy times and not so long ago

how I wondered where they'd gone.

But they're back again just like a long lost friend

all the songs I love so well.

Every shalalala every wo'wo

Still shines.

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

That they're starting to sing

So fine

When they get to the part

Where he's breaking her heart

It can really make me cry

Just like before.

It's yesterday once more.

(shoobie do lang lang)

Looking back on how it was in years gone by

And the good times that I had

Makes today seem rather sad,

So much has changed.

It was songs of love that I would sing to them

and I'd memorize each word.

Those old melodies still sound so good to me

As they melt the years away

Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

That they're starting to sing

So fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me

Some can even make me cry

Just like before.

It's yesterday once more.

(shoobie do lang lang)

Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines.

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

That they're starting to sing

So fine

Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines.
